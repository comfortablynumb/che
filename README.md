## Introduction

This library aims to meet the following requirements:

* It must have all the functions and data structures that we use in our everyday tasks, but that are not present in Golang's standard library: Slices and maps related functions, data structures like sets, etc.
* It must provide higher level APIs for functionalities like file handling, networking, etc.
* It must have **zero dependencies**.
* It must have **100% coverage**.

The following is a list of specific desired features that I want this library to have in the coming months:

- [x] Slices related functions: Unique, Diff, Intersect, etc.
- [ ] Maps related functions: Keys, etc.
- [ ] Data structures: Sets, etc.
- [ ] Structs that allow to use the slices and maps functions with a fluid interface.
- [ ] File handling related functions.
- [ ] Networking related functions.
- [ ] More to come!
